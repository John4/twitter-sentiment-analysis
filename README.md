# twitter-sentiment-analysis
A rudimentary piece of Python that derives interesting data from tweets.

# running
- Notice the shebang at the top of the `main.py` script. Be sure this points to your local version of python 3.x.
- Executing is as easy as `./main.py` in your terminal.
- Be sure to check the paths in `main.py`. You'll need to supply some json tweets. If you're our professor, we provided them to you. Else, go find some.
- Enjoy, and check the directory for `results.txt`.

Be wary of excessively large datasets...
